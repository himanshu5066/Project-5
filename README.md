Project Overview:-
This project was created to help a potential investor decide whether to buy TellCo, a telecom company in the Republic of Pefkakia. 
The investor asked for a detailed analysis of TellCoâ€™s user data to understand customer behavior and identify ways to grow the business.

1. User Overview :-
Find most used handsets and top manufacturers.
Analyze user behavior (e.g., session counts, download/upload data).
Create visual and statistical summaries.

2. User Engagement:-
Measure user activity: session frequency, duration, and data traffic.
Group users into engagement levels using clustering (K-Means).
Identify top users per application (like YouTube, Social Media, etc.).

3. User Experience:-
Look at technical performance like network speed and device type.
Group users based on experience (good vs. bad).
Analyze key metrics like throughput and TCP retransmission.

4. User Satisfaction:-
Calculate satisfaction scores based on engagement + experience.
Build a regression model to predict satisfaction.
Export results to a MySQL database.
Track model versions and performance using MLOps tools.

Tools & Technologies:-
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Clustering (K-Means), PCA for dimensionality reduction
Streamlit or Flask for dashboard
MySQL for data storage
Git & GitHub for version control
Docker or MLflow (optional) for model tracking
